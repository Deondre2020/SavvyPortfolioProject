  <h1>Greetings Ferguson Residents</h1>

  <p>
    Greetings Ferguson Residents:

  My name is Jacqueline Patton. I am a former paralegal, legislative assistant,
and city clerk. During my years with both legislators, and city government I
realized that voters did not have the necessary information in order to make a
sound decisions in the voting process. I want to change all that. The Voter
newsletter is to help keep residents informed of decisions that are made by
their local government. While working in the legislator it occured to me that
many people don’t understand the legislative process. How a bill becomes law,
the process for which that bill takes in order to become law. Also, each year
residents are asked to vote for certain individuals who want to hold political
office. Yet, many of you know absolutely nothing regarding that candidate,
other than what that candidate projects to you. I want to change all this by
giving you information regarding that candidate, their background, and their
understanding of the political process.

  You are asked to vote on judges every 2 years, yet the information received on
how these judges run their courts are 0 to none. Why is it important to know our
elected officials and the judges that will be serving the 21st Judicial Circuit.
These decisions have the to impact your life and livelihood. The Voter is
committed to bring you the best and most accurate information in order for you
to make the best decisions when selecting individuals for elected office.

  Over the years I have stood by and watched voters elect individuals who had
absolutely no understanding of the political arena. Why does this hurt us. If
our elected officials are not abreast of the political arena, they are ill
equipped to handle our needs or concerns. They are unable to reach out and get
us the help we need. When electing a public official voters must understand they
are electing someone to govern their community. You should want this person’s
history of community service, background, as well as how they will your
community if elected.

  The Voter hopes to enlighten you on propositions presented to you for your vote.
There are times when not enough information is given in time for you to make a
conscious decision on propositions. Again, The Voter hopes to change that.

  This first edition is simply to introduce you to The Voter. My hopes and dreams
are that The Voter will become a local newsletter serving communities across the
city and county of St. Louis. If you are a elected official and would like
events or legislation, please feel free to contact me at (314) - 709-7786.

  Lets all have a clear understanding of the political process and the people who
serve us.

Sincerly,

Jaqueline Patton
Editor
